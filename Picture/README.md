### Project for training from [Udemy][1] JavaScript practice course
----
Created simple components with native JavaScript:
- accordion
- burger
- calc
- forms
- sliders
- modals
---
Also worked with other modules like:
- validation mask for inputs
- picture resizing
- scrolling for links
- filters
- drag & drop component
----
I have done this project with homework where I updated:
- [x] accordion with hide other elements feature
- [x] filter script for less code
- [x] forms for interaction with modal
- [x] loading selects information from server
- [x] some updates validation mask
-----
- [x] Also for webpack and other tasks was used gulp.
