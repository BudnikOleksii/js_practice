### Project for training from [Udemy][1] course
----
Created simple components with native JavaScript:
- tabs
- timer
- modals
- forms
- carousel
- calc
---
Practiced with:
- Git
- JSON
- Local storage
- Webpack
- Babel
----
I have done this project one more time because, I had goals:
- [x] to do it by myself without peeking for help
- [x] practice with Git
- [x] explore other tools for deeper understanding them
- [x] and also wanted to take a look for old exercises with new knowledge
